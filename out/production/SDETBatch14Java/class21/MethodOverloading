Method Overloading:
-Allows us to have same name methods or constructors but with different parameters

Why use Method Overloading?
-Gives flexibility to end user so they can call a different method in different ways
-Helps write cleaner code

Syntax:
Create different methods but keep the following points in mind
1. Overload method by passing diff num of para
2. changing data type of para
3. changing sequence
