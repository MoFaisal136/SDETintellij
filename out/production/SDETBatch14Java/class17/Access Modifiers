*Access Modifiers:
-Are Keywords in Java that ctrl the access of methods, fields, or the class
-4 access lvls

Lvl 1) KEYWORD Private-> can only be accessed within the same class. MOST RESTRICTED.
For (fields/properties/state of a class), we should always try to have private access
so that data is secured

Lvl 2) Default-> not a keyword its just an access lvl. If we don't we use any keyword java
applies automatically. Once applied we can access those entities within the same class as well
as any class within same package.

Lvl 3) KEYWORD Protected -> When applied entities can be accessed outside of the package as well
but only in the class that has parent-child relationship.

Lvl 4) KEYWORD Public -> When applied to an entity that entity can be accessed anywhere
inside that project. Usually the classes itself and methods are declared as public.

NOTE:
If we are inside the same class we can call a method inside another by just writing its name.
But we need to take care that these methods are both either static or non-static.
