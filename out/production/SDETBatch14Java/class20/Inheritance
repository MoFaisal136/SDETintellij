Inheritance: A mechanism through which a class can inherit the properties and methods of another class

Why learn?: -Helps avoid code redundancy -helps save space -helps improve execution speed

Syntax: use "extends" keyword and "nameOfClass" of which we want to inherit the fields and methods
while declaring the class

Types of Inheritance: 4 Types but 3 used in JAVA
1)Single - When we have only one parent and one child class. NOT widely used.

2)Multilevel - One top level and one base class and many intermediate classes. For EX) A<B<C<D<....

3)Hierarchical - When we have one parent class and multiple child classes

4)Multiple(NOT SUPP BY JAVA) one child and multiple parent classes.
Diamond problem - issue with same name classes and creates confusion where child class gets info

5) Super keyword: used to explicitly call the variable form the parent class. When we have same name
instance variable in child class and parent class.
Can also use super keyword to call constructor of the parent class

MethodOverloading - Method overloading allows us to create multiple same name methods in a class
WITH different DATA TYPES, DIFFERENT PARAMETERS, DIFFERENT SEQUENCE OF PARAMETERS

Why should we create multiple methods with same name?
-Gives end user flexibility
-End user can call same method with different parameters to get same or different results

How do we overload a method?
1) by passing different number of parameters
2) by changing the datatype
3) by changing the sequence of parameters
