"this" is a keyword like class and void. If we have the same name instance and a local variable
we can use "this()" to call a constructor inside another constructor

Why learn "this" keyword:
1) it allows us to have same name local and instance variable
2) if we have the same code in two constructors we can reuse that code from one constructor inside another
constructor by writing "this()"

Inheritance:
1) Is a mechanism in java through which we can use the fields/methods of one class inside another class

* There are 4 types of Inheritance:

1) Single Inheritance: we have only one parent and one child class  EX) Employee->Person

2) Multilevel Inheritance: inheritance in multiple levels   EX) Grandfather->Father->Son->Grandson

3) Hierarchical Inheritance: One parent class and multiple direct child classes EX) Car class, Animal class

4) Multiple Inheritance:(NOT SUPPORTED BY JAVA) One child class can directly inherit from multiple
parent classes (AKA DIAMOND PROBLEM)

* Why learn inheritance:
-Allows us to reduce duplicate codee

* What is the syntax?
-we can use this feature by writing "extends" keyword when declaring a class
